# RISC-V-Group-20

**Objectives**

- To learn RISC-V 32-bit integer instruction set architecture
- To implement a single-cycle RV32I instruction set in a microarchitecture
- To implement the F1 starting light algorithm in RV32I assembly language
- To verify your RV32I design
- As stretched goal, to implement a simple pipelined version of the microarchitecture with hazard
- detection and mitigation
- As a further stretched goal, add data cache to the pipelined RV32I
- As a further streched goal, complete the RV32I processor
